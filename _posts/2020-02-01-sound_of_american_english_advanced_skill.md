# 美式发音高阶技巧的十条规则

* 连读，如何连读，为什么连读  
连读可以产生一种母语式的自然发音  
* 精简单词，如何精简单词，为什么精简单词  
精简单词可以加强你的语气  
* 难发音的，经常犯的一些错误  
* 非正式场合和正式场合的语气

## 规则一：辅音和元音的连续（linking consonant and vowel）
连续指的两个单词连起来读，linking = connecting words together  
> 美国人在说英语的时候，都遵循一些特定的规则。但是他们没有下意识的去遵守规则，很自然流畅的地把这些单词连在一起。
非英语母语的人，就需要学习这些规则。如果你没有连续，那么口语就比较呆板。例如：how are you？

* 当一个读单词以辅音结尾，并且后面跟着的单词以元音开头，这些单词连续
> in an instant => i na ni mstant  
john is a friend of mine => joh ni sa frien do f mine  
i'm an actor => i' ma na ctor

注意：
1. 连续并不意味着语速快，don't speak fast
2. 关键词和实义词要重读，否则分不清开始和结尾
3. 分组间不用连续，例如：i'll call you / in an instant.

更多练习：
> build up => buil dup  
come over => ca nover  
where is => whe ris  
call up => ca lup  
for a while => fo ra while  
what if => wha dif, t在两个元音之间，读音变成短促的d音

> hold on a minute => hol don a minute  
just a moment => justa moment  
a cup of tea => acupof tea  
can i think it over => thin kit

## 规则二：两个辅音的连续 （linking consonant to consonant）
当一个单词以辅音结尾，而下一个单词以辅音开头：

* 如果两个辅音一样，可以只发一次音，不要切成两个单词
> bill likes swimming => bilikeswiming  
stop practicing  
next time  
wish she  
bad day  
bob baker  
going great 
* 把相同发音点的辅音连续，发音点指的是发音的接触点（link consonants that have the same point of articulation）  
例如，'p'和'b'有相同的发音点，两个都需要嘴巴合拢；'t'和'd'也有，因为偶是通过舌头碰触牙齿背面发音 
> used to => d不发音  
five friend => v和f 
big kitchen => g和k  
suppose to => s和t  
need to => d和t  

* 当辅音的发音是停顿时，例如'p', 'b', 't', 'd'，跟着的另一个辅音尽管发音点和前面的不一样，
但也要确保的第一个辅音连续读  
> a back door, help me  
**记住：千万忽略结尾的辅音，如果不是在句末时，后面还跟着其他单词时，也要注意辅音是否发音**

更多练习：
> i wish she woul dt alk to me.  
di dt hat man know about the situation.  
i coul dd rive you there right now.  
he alway ss eem ss o happy.  
i used(x) to work crazy hours bu these days i've slowe dd own.  

**记住：辅音到另一个辅音，平滑很多**

## 规则三：元音和元音的连接（linking vowel to vowel）
当单词以元音结尾，后面的单词以元音开头时，连续；例如：see it => see yit，y是一个短促的y

* 当元音要求你的嘴唇发音变平时，例如元音i，ai，ei，发音是/yuh/
> very interesting => very (y)interesting  
carry on => carry yon  
we all => we yall  
may i => may yi  
enjoy it,  boy is  

* 当元音让你的嘴唇变圆时，发音是/u/或/ou/ 
> who is => who wis  
do all, no one, two hour, no answer, blue ocean.

> i don't do it ver yo ften.  
why is she so afraid o fi t?  
i can see inside the open window.  
this is the onl yoo ne i know about  
did you see any other ones?  

## 规则四：单词轻读
单词轻读的目的是使连续变得平滑，自然。节奏和重读恰当的另一个规则。  
关键是要知道那个单词要轻读，轻读要怎么发音

* 重读实义词（content word），比如名词，动词，形容词，副词；
* 轻读功能词（function word），比如代词，介词，冠词，助动词
> 助动词包括will, am, is, do, does，当轻读这些词时，一般都是缩写形式，i'll go, i'm  

当我们轻读介词时，介词的元音一般变成了中性词，发"əh"音，示例如下：

|轻读介词|示例|
|:---|:---|
|as = /əs/|as long as you want, as soon as possible, as far as i know|
|on = /ən/|on monday, come on time|
|at = /ət/|at home, at school, at five|
|to = /tə/|to the store, to go, to work|
|for = /fər/|for a while, for a moment, for along time|
|or = /ər/|yes or no, good or bad, this or that|
|our = /ər/|this is our house|
|and = /n/|rock and roll, in and out, this and that, john and marry|

更多练习：
> i'd like to see you for a moment  
sooner oor latter, you'll meet our parents.  
i went to work, at nine o'clock.  
i had bacon and eggs for breakfast.  
do you like black and white or color photos?  

**记：轻读功能词并不意味你可以说快；遇到实义词还是要放慢语速**

## 规则五：单词轻读（二）
轻读代词
* 开头是h和th
> he did  
did he => dide （正式情况下就不轻读），扩展到could，should，would  
him => i tol dim, call him => i'll callm
ask him => askm  
see him => seem  
her, caller, love her => lover, like her => liker, drive her => driver  
th省略，i'll pick them up => pickem up  
buy them => buyem  

**当代词以h或th开头，例如：he, his, him, her, hers, them，情况都一样，可以去掉第一个辅音字母**

**注意：当代词在句首时，不能省略h或th，要把这两个音发出来；有时出于特殊的原因，要重读代词**

## 规则六：缩写（contractions）
缩写在日常交流中非常重要，不使用缩写说话的口音就像一个初学者，还在一个单词一个单词分开读
> don't do that，发音don't 和do易混淆，如果拆开读do not do that，表示很生气  
**为了突出或强调的时候，不使用缩写**
> i've been there  
i will => i'll, 不要发ill，要在i和l之间加一个/ə/的音  
he will => he'll  
it will => it'll, t发d的音，类似的，little => /liddle/  
she'll, they'll  
i would, i had 都缩写是i'd  
he would -> he'd  
has -> he has -> he's here  
are -> you're, they are -> they're, we're hungry  
i've, they've, we've, they've been there.  

更多练习：
> it'll rain all day  
it's good that you're home.  
he'll call me and i'll give him the number.  
we waited because you said you'd come.  
i've already eaten but he'ss still hungry.  

**记住：缩写不一定就是非正式的语言**

## 规则七：难懂的缩写（difficult contractions）
could have -> could dave -> could've  
should have -> should dove 发/əv/  
would've  
could not have, ot不发音，-> couldnve，类似的，shouldnve, wouldnve，例如：they wouldnve know  
would you have -> would you've, 类似的, should you've  
how would she have known -> she've  

更多练习:
> you should've seen itt  
you should've liked it  
i shouldn't have said that to him  
i wouldn't have called you if i'd known you were sleeping  
you wouldn't have been tired, if you'd gone to bed earlier.  
what would you've said too her  

**记住：could've, couldnve, would've**

## 规则八：省略音节（dropped syllables）
纠正常见的错误，有些单词的元音是完全不发音的，音节也可以省略  

|不发音的元音|示例|
|:---|:---|
|/a/|basic -> basic~~a~~lly, accident -> accident~~a~~lly, actual -> actu~~a~~lly, practical -> practic~~a~~lly, physical -> physic~~a~~lly, general -> gener~~a~~lly|
|/e/|veg~~e~~table, int~~e~~resting, diff~~e~~rent| 
|/o/|choc~~o~~late, comfortable -> comf tr able| 

更多例子：
> aspirin -> /asprin/, evening -> /eving/, family -> /famly/  
beverage -> /bevrage/, naturally -> naturlly, catholic -> /cathlic/  
miserable -> /misrable/, favorite -> /favrite/, extraordinary -> /extradinary/  
preference -> /prefrence/, temperature -> /temprature/,  
broccoli -> /broccli/  
diamond -> /dimond/  
laboratory -> /labratory/, several -> /sveral/, opera -> /opra/, camera -> /camra/  

更多练习：
> i'd like a chocolate beverage  
let's go to a different restaurant  
every evening she takes an aspirin  
basically, they're different  
i went to an extraordinary opera last night  
i actually like broccoli

## 规则九：比较难的单词
纠正常见错误：关于不发音的字母，比如know，k不发音；bomb，末尾的b不发音

|不发音的字母组合|示例|
|:---|:---|
|b|bom~~b~~, clim~~b~~, de~~b~~t, su~~b~~tle, dou~~b~~t|
|ch|ya~~ch~~t|
|d|a~~d~~just, a~~d~~jective|
|l|wa~~l~~k, ta~~l~~k, cou~~l~~d, wou~~l~~d, shou~~l~~d, ha~~l~~f|
|t|balle~~t~~(y), bouque~~t~~/bu'kei/, vale~~t~~, chevrole~~t~~|
|th|mou~~th~~s, clo~~th~~es|
|p|recei~~p~~t, ~~p~~sychology, ~~p~~sychic, cu~~p~~board|
|s|arkansa~~s~~, illinoi~~s~~, i~~s~~land, debri~~s~~|
|w|ans~~w~~er|

**t不发音的单词经常出现在法语演变过来的单词中**

## 规则十：轻松的语音（relax speech）
把讲话的形式和日常的轻松对话做比较
* have -> a, coulda, i woulda call you, i coulda come over
> would have -> woulda, should have -> shoulda
* of -> a, sort of -> soda, kind of -> kinda -> i'm kinda tired, cup of a coffee -> cupa coffee
* to -> a, want to -> wanna -> i wanna go, got to -> gotta -> i gotta eat/go  

几条非正式的讲话规则：
* let me -> lemme -> lemme go, lemme help you
* give me -> gimme -> gimme a call, gimme that  
* ing结尾, in~~g~~ = in，在非正式语中，比如歌词中，年轻人的说话方式, going = goin, doin, what's happin  

更多练习：
> you shoulda told me earlier.  
i coulda helped you  
i wanna get a cup of coffee.  
he's gonna make a lotta money.  
we gotta go shopping because we're outta food.  
lemme introduce you to a frienda mine.
